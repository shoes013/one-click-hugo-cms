This Repository was the first id ever created quite a while ago. At that time I knew little about github but wanted to know more.

 I have been interested in computers since the early 80's, when a friend of mine offered me a job (no experience necessary he said) "we just need a warm body to watch over the data center in the evening hours,you know,someone who can be on site in case something happens. 

well that was 35 years ago. it's been a exciting ride over the years. I expect use this  site to curate and showcase a few Ai projects I've been working on recently. stay tuned and let's us talk again a little later.
